With this plugin you:

- Store features (Elasticsearch query templates) in Elasticsearch 
- Implement query primitives that go beyond the Elasticsearch Query DSL
- Log features scores (relevance scores) for a set of documents to prime training
- Upload an xgboost or ranklib ranking model to Elasticsearch
- Rank search results using an xgboost or ranklib model

What this plugin is NOT:

- Learning to rank training in Elasticsearch, training is done offline with specialized tools like xgboost/ranklib using judgment lists + gathered features
- Judgment list / click traffic tracking in Elasticsearch. You need to instrument your application/work with domain experts to arrived at search correctness data.

For more background on machine learning in search, read [this blog article](http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/08/03/search-as-machine-learning-prob/).


# How the plugin works

You create *feature stores* to back your model. Within the feature store, features are grouped into feature sets. What are features in this context? Features are mustache templated Elasticsearch queries. For example a template that takes the search terms as an argument. Several new Elasticsearch query primitives are introduced by the plugin to assist with feature development.

Feature sets can be logged either during a live user query or after-the-fact using the `sltr` query. You gather judgment lists (what docs are good/bad for a query) based on domain-specific factors. With logged features and judgment lists, you can train a model offline. The model learns to generalize the ranking expressed in the judgment list as a function of the features. 

You store a model into the learning to rank plugin, associating it with the feature set used during training. The features from the feature set are copied into the model, and the model cannot be changed. The features within a model are also frozen. You search with this model using the `sltr` query.

Improve your model by improving features, retraining with new feature sets, and then creating new models.

## Great, I want to jump in!

If you want to just jump in, go straight to the demo. The demo uses Ranklib, a Java Learning to Rank library, to train models. Follow the directions in the [demo README](demo/README.md), edit code, and have fun!

## I need more detailed documentation

Learning to Rank can be tremendously powerful. However, building a real-life learning to rank system is non-trivial. We've developed a [guide](guide/) that serves as a mini-book on using the features of this plugin to develop a learning to rank system. It serves as the API documentation as well.

# Installing

Generally new features follow the latest ES version, but you can get older versions on older ES versions. The format of the filename follows this
convention: `ltr-query-<PLUGIN VERSION>-es<ES VERSION>.zip`. The full listing
can be found [here](http://es-learn-to-rank.labs.o19s.com). For example, to install version 0.1.2 of the plugin on ES 5.4.0, do the following:

`./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install http://es-learn-to-rank.labs.o19s.com/ltr-query-0.1.2-es5.4.0.zip`

(It's expected you'll confirm some security exceptions, you can pass `-b` to `elasticsearch-plugin` to automatically install)

# Development

Notes if you want to dig into the code.

### 1. Build with Gradle Wrapper

```
./gradlew clean check
```

This runs the tasks in the `esplugin` gradle plugin that builds, tests, generates a Elasticsearch plugin zip file.

### 2. Install with `./bin/elasticsearch-plugin`

```
./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///path/to/project/build/distributions/ltr-query-0.1.2-es5.4.0.zip
```
