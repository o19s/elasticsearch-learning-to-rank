Elasticsearch Learning to Rank: the documentation
==========================================================

`Learning to Rank <http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/24/what-is-learning-to-rank/>`_ applies machine learning to  relevance ranking. The `Elasticsearch Learning to Rank plugin <http://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank>`_ (Elasticsearch LTR) gives you tools to train and use ranking models in Elasticsearch. This plugin powers search at places like Wikimedia Foundation and Snagajob.

Get started
-------------------------------

- Want a quickstart? Check out the `demo <https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank/tree/master/demo>`_. 
- Brand new to learning to rank? head to :doc:`core-concepts`. 
- Otherwise, start with :doc:`fits-in`

Installing
-----------

Pre-built versions can be found `here <http://es-learn-to-rank.labs.o19s.com/>`_. Want a build for an ES version? Follow the instructions in the `README for building <https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank#development>`_ or `create an issue <https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank/issues>`_. Once you've found a version compatible with your Elasticsearch, you'd run a command such as::

    ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install \ 
    http://es-learn-to-rank.labs.o19s.com/ltr-1.0.0-RC2-es5.6.4.zip

(It's expected you'll confirm some security exceptions, you can pass -b to elasticsearch-plugin to automatically install)

Are you using `x-pack security <https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/security>`_ in your cluster? we got you covered, check :doc:`x-pack` for specific configuration details.

HEEELP!
