Elasticsearch Learning to Rank: the documentation
==========================================================

`Learning to Rank <http://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/24/what-is-learning-to-rank/>`_ uses machine learning to manipulate relevance ranking. The `Elasticsearch Learning to Rank plugin <http://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank>`_ (Elasticsearch LTR) enables you to train and use ranking models in your Elasticsearch search system.
