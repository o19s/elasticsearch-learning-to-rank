How does the plugin fit in?
******************************

In :doc:`core-concepts` we mentioned a couple of activities you undertake when implementing learning to rank:

1. Judgment List Development
2. Feature Engineering
3. Logging features into the judgment list to create a training set
4. Training and testing models
5. Deploying and using models when searching

How does Elasticsearch LTR fit into this process? 

=======================
What the plugin is NOT
=======================

The plugin does not help with judgment list creation. This is work you must do and can be very domain specific. Wikimedia Foundation wrote a `great article <https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/09/19/search-relevance-survey/>`_ on how they arrive at judgment lists for people searching articles. Other domains such as e-commerce might be more conversion focused. Yet others might involve human relevance judges -- either experts at your company or mechanical turk.

The plugin does not train or test models. This also happens offline in tools appropriate to the task. Instead the plugin uses models generated by XGboost and Ranklib libraries. Training and testing models is CPU intensive task that, involving data scientist supervision and offline testing. Most organizations want some data science supervision on model development. And you would not want this running in your production Elasticsearch cluster!

=======================
What the plugin does
=======================

This plugin gives you building blocks to develop and use learning to rank models. It lets you develop query-dependent features and store them in Elasticsearch. After storing a set of features, you can log them for documents returned in search results. 

Then other tools take over. With a logged set of features for documents, you join data with your judgment lists you've developed on your own. You've now got a training set you can use to test/train ranking models. Using of a tool like Ranklib or XGboost, you'll hopefully arrive at a satisfactory model.

With a ranking model, you turn back to the plugin. You upload the model with a name. The model is associated with the set of features used to generate the training data. You can then search with the model, using a custom Elasticsearch Query DSL primitive that executes the model. Hopefully this lets you deliver better search to users!

The rest of this guide is dedicated to walking you through how the plugin works to get you there.
